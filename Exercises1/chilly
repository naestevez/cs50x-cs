It's a chilly  morning. Early and itching to code again. Yay! I accidently erased my file trying to play with the command line so I'm just writing this now so I can practice the "sed" and "grep" commands as well as piping commands. I feel I've learned a lot so far but I really want to get better.
Perhaps, advanced level. I hope after the 3 month ruby course I can continue learning C though. I really like the language and I want to know that one too. OK. So I gotta go now. Peace.
